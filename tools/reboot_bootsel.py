Reboot the ds4dongle into BOOTSEL (USB bootloader) from the host, so it can be
reflashed without the physical BOOTSEL button.

Sends HID feature report 0xF6 with funcid 0x04, which firmware that includes the
reboot command (src/cmd.cpp: `buffer[0] == 0x04 -> reset_usb_boot()`) answers by
dropping into BOOTSEL. The dongle then enumerates as the RP2350 mass-storage
drive. The HID device disappears mid-request, so a send error here is EXPECTED
and means success.

Requires: pip install hidapi
Run:      python reboot_bootsel.py
