# DS4Dongle — Pico 2 W DualShock 4 Bridge

Firmware for the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W that hosts a DualShock 4 over
Bluetooth Classic and presents it to the PC as a **wired DualShock 4 v2**
(054C:09CC) — including audio to the controller's speaker and headphone jack.

Adapted from [awalol/DS5Dongle](https://github.com/awalol/DS5Dongle), which
does the same for the DualSense. If you have a DualSense, use DS5Dongle
directly.

> **Status: pre-release.** Works on the author's hardware (DS4 v1 + Pico 2 W,
> Linux host). Microphone input is not implemented yet. Expect rough edges.

## Features

- Wired DS4 v2 USB persona with the real HID report descriptor: gamepad,
  motion sensors, touchpad, rumble, lightbar
- Calibration passthrough (BT report 0x05 translated to USB report 0x02)
- Audio out to the controller speaker and headphone jack: USB audio at the
  DS4's native 32 kHz stereo, SBC-encoded on-device (no resampling); routing
  auto-switches when a headset is plugged into the jack
- Volume/mute from the host mapped to the controller
- Pairing and controller management via the BOOTSEL button, persistent
  pairings and blacklist in flash
- Configurable over HID feature reports (`tools/config_tool.py`): polling
  rate, audio routing, inactivity timeout, wake-on-PS, and more

## Flashing

1. Hold BOOTSEL while plugging the Pico 2 W in; it mounts as a USB drive.
2. Copy `ds4-bridge.uf2` onto it.

Grab pre-built firmware from the Releases page (`ds4-bridge.uf2`; the
`-debug` variant adds a USB serial console for troubleshooting and changes
the USB persona — don't use it for play).

## Pairing

1. With the controller off, hold **Share**, then **PS**, until the lightbar
   double-flashes rapidly.
2. Short-press the Pico's **BOOTSEL button**. The LED blinks while searching
   and turns solid when connected; the lightbar flashes gold once.
3. Afterwards a plain PS press reconnects. The dongle only appears on USB
   while a controller is connected.

BOOTSEL while running: **click** = pair/switch controller, **double-click** =
reboot, **triple-click** = reboot into the bootloader for flashing,
**hold ~1.5 s** = forget all controllers.

## Building

Requires `arm-none-eabi-gcc`, CMake, Ninja, and pico-sdk 2.3.0 with TinyUSB
pinned to 0.21.0:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --branch 2.3.0 https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk
git -C pico-sdk submodule update --init --recursive
git -C pico-sdk/lib/tinyusb fetch --depth 1 origin refs/tags/0.21.0:refs/tags/0.21.0
git -C pico-sdk/lib/tinyusb checkout 0.21.0

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DPICO_SDK_PATH=$PWD/pico-sdk
cmake --build build
# → build/ds4-bridge.uf2
```

`-DENABLE_SERIAL=ON -DENABLE_VERBOSE=ON` builds the debug variant.

## Debugging

The debug firmware (`ds4-bridge-debug.uf2`, or a `-DENABLE_SERIAL=ON` build)
differs from the production build in three ways: it adds a USB CDC serial
console, it stays on the USB bus from boot (the production build hides USB
until a controller is connected), and the watchdog is disabled so a fault
prints instead of silently rebooting.

To use it:

1. Flash the debug UF2 (see [Flashing](#flashing)).
2. Open the serial console — the port appears as soon as the Pico boots:

   ```sh
   # Linux (any of these)
   tio /dev/ttyACM0
   picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0
   # Windows: PuTTY on the new COM port, 115200 baud
   ```

3. Reproduce the problem (pair, connect, play audio). Log lines are prefixed
   by subsystem: `[HCI]` Bluetooth link events (inquiry, connect, auth,
   encryption, disconnect reasons), `[L2CAP]` HID channel setup and traffic,
   `[BT]` button actions and pairing state, `[BLACKLIST]` pairing blacklist,
   `[AUDIO]`/`[Audio]` USB audio and SBC pipeline, `[CMD]`/`[Config]` config
   reports, `[USBHID]` report forwarding.

What healthy output looks like: pairing runs `Gamepad found` →
`ACL connected` → `Authentication complete` → `Encryption change ... enabled=1`
→ `HID Control opened` → `HID Interrupt opened` → `Connected DS4 Controller`.
A `Disconnected reason=0x13` right after `HID Control opened` means the
controller aborted the handshake; `reason=0x08` is a supervision timeout
(range/battery). If the controller connects and immediately drops with the
production build but works in debug, suspect the watchdog (a stall >1 s
reboots the dongle).

Notes: the debug build's USB persona differs (extra CDC interface, audio
visible before a controller connects), so drivers and games may treat it
differently — use it for diagnosis only. While USB audio is streaming, the
console fills with send-FIFO warnings during (re)connects; pause or suspend
the dongle's audio sink to get a clean pairing trace.
